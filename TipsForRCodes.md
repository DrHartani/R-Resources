# How to Perform Projects in R Efficiently?

In this page, I try to provide useful suggestions on how to organize folders and write better code in R programming. The emphasis is on the importance of having a consistent and logical folder structure, which can help to save time and reduce errors when working with large projects. 

This page also provides tips for naming files and folders, such as using meaningful and descriptive names that can be easily understood by yourself and by  others if yourking in a team.  Overall, the main purpose I write this page is to give practical advice that can help students improve their workflow and produce more efficient and readable code. 

Note that some of the recommended suggestions are based my personal preference, so I suggest stick to whatever suits you best:

## Organizing the Project
Organazing a project into files is of paramount importance, I suggest start creating few folders:
  1. Data: A directory (folder) for storing raw and processed data
  2. Graph : A directory (folder) for storing all kinds of plots
  3. Reports: A directory (folder) for storing .Rmd, .md or .tex files
  4. RCode: A directory to store the R source code.


## Choosing a Good IDE 
Choosing a goode IDE helps carry out projects a great deal. An IDE has options that help organize the project easily such as creating the files above without leaving the environment. You have everything in one place
  - Using RStudio: This the best and the most recommended IDE
  - VS Code: It is a good IDE 
  -  Eclips for R


## How to Write Better in Code in R?

Writing better code is some kind of an art, some codes are beatiful and some are ugly. I try to provide tips to write beautiful code. 




  1. Use headers to indicate 
• create a script or program to store R commands;
• use RStudio;
• lay out the program with lots of spaces, indents and comments (using #);
• be clear about what is wanted from the code: once that is done, stop;
• test the program, line by line, as it is written;
• use object names that mean something;

- using clear and concise variable names
-  commenting code to explain its purpose,
-  Avoiding duplicate code whenever possible.
• try not to use attach (): if it is absolutely necessary, then use detach () immediately after finishing use of the dataframe;
• always look for an alternative to loops, although there may not be one.
